## What is an internal hacking event?

It's a fun event, possibly a contest, where teams of engineers from diverse roles and backgrounds unite for a day of security testing to uncover vulnerabilities in their applications. It's a prime opportunity to:

- Elevate security awareness
- Train individuals in security testing
- Discover genuine vulnerabilities
- And, of course, have fun!

Still curious? For more details, visit the [WhySuchEvent](./doc-for-organizers/pre-event/WhySuchEvent.md) to know more.

## Who can do it?

Whatever your job position, if you believe it is a good initiative then you should go for it!
Organizing such an event could be done by different people at different position and does not require real expertise, especially with such a good starter kit at hand.

We are software engineers with a technical focus, and we learned **a lot** by organizing these events!

If you like the idea but are unsure about taking it on, no worries. You can reach out to someone who might be interested and remain part of the organizing team!

This repository offers documentation and materials for organizing your own event, created from Amadeus' experience with internal hacking events.

- Start with **[Organization.md](./doc-for-organizers/Organization.md)**
- The [material](./material/) folder provides the material needed for the participants.

This repository is open to everyone, encouraging inspiration and contributions to the kit!
Share your experiences on the [Testimony.md](./Testimony.md) page.

Happy hacking!
