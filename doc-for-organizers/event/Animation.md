Make the event successful and fun!

## Bring food and coffee

A good way to start the days is by sharing the breakfast together. The teams will meet their coach at that occasion.
You can also invite the management and security point of contacts, like the CISO.

## Create emulation inside the rooms

If possible, all participants should be in the same room or same area, to boost the motivation.
Curious security point of contacts or managers are welcome to enter in the room and see who it is going.
Feel free to fetch them!

Also, brig your best Pirate decoration, like flags, pictures or treasure chest.

## Make sure the coach are helping each team

The hacking event is a difficult exercise, but the coaches should be available to help, especially if a team feels blocked.

## Create a support channel

In case of technical or functional issue, make sure some experts are available for help event if they do not attend the event. It could be people in charge of the infrastructure, test platforms, QA engineers.
A dedicated room with your instant messaging system is a good option.
