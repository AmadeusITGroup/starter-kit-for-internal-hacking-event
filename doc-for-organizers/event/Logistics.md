# Logistics

To get a comfortable event, we suggest the following:

## A Common room with screens, keyboard and mouse

To avoid spending a full day on a laptop screen.
Putting all the teams together help a lot the hacking atmosphere and fun during the event

## Catering

If possible, invite the participants to share a breakfast before the event.
It will help team members and coaches to know each other, and encourage people to be on time. Free food is a powerful incentive :wink:

You can do the same thing for the Kick off and training session, for example with a breakfast or coffee break.

## Goodies

You can prepare some goodies for the participants.
We also encourages you to reward the coach/judge with different one.

Stickers are quite efficient for many reasons

- It's cheap and not *too* bad for the environment
- It's usually in the software development spirit
- It's a publicity that the participants will STICK on their laptop so they may be questioned about it and it will make your event even more successful

## Decoration

Make the event fun! You can bring pirate-theme decoration like a treasure chest, parrot, ...
