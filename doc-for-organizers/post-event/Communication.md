# Communication after the event

The aim, here, is to show your (and the teams) success and encourage the event to be organized again.

Use the same communication channels to:

- Thank the participants and organizers
- Congratulates the winners
- Add pictures!
- Give the link to this guide, for next edition :wink:
- Update the [testimony](./../../Testimony.md) page of this repository
