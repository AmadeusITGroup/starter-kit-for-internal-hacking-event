# Survey

## Goal
The goal of the survey is to get direct feedback from participant regarding
- The communication
- The logistics
- The event itself
But the most important is to get an idea on how much the participant liked the event !

## Tips
The idea is to find the balance beetween the information you want and being short to ensure a full completion.

A trick you could use is to tell to the team you'll only reward the teams who filled the survey.
