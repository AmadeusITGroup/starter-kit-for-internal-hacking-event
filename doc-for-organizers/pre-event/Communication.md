# Communication before the event

The aim is to make people register.
You can make your top management or CISO send a global communication, telling how to register.

Insist on the benefits for the participants:

- Do something different for one day
- Play the Hacker
- Learn about security
- Meet new people and have fun!

Use as much communication channels as possible: mail, internal social media, meetings, ...

## Communication with you security teams

Make also the security teams aware of the event, as their monitoring can show an increase of security events or issues.

## Branding

We encourage you to create a logo and a specific branding for the event.
A nice logo will make your event more professional and encourage people to join.

You can use a generative AI (no link as it's evolving so fast) or request your communication specialist to help you.
