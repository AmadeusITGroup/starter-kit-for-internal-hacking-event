Organizing a Hacking Event event takes time, and several people should support it:

- The main organizer, usually working on security, in charge of the whole preparation and support before and after the event.
If you are reading this document, it is probably you!
You can count a minimum of 3 weeks of work full time for ~100 participants.

- Site organizers, if the event is multi-site. They will be in charge of the on-site organization and support on local time zones

- Management, to help on the communication, adoption, logistics (food, goodies, ...)

- Security managers / security office, to act as coaches and judges

- Other security experts for support

Coaches are a crucial part of the Hacking Event. They are the security specialists with penetration testing knowledge that will support and train the teams during their hacking attempts.

You should contact for example the Offensive & Software Security teams, or your CISO.

The coaches must be available the full day of the event and the judgment day.
